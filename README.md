# Here are step-by-step deployment instructions for running the Streamlit app locally on your machine:

### 1. Install Python and Streamlit
- Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- After installing Python, install Streamlit using pip:
  ```
  pip install streamlit
  ```

### 2. Clone the Streamlit App Repository
- Clone the repository containing your Streamlit app code from a version control system like GitHub.

### 3. Navigate to the App Directory
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your Streamlit app code is located.

### 4. Install Required Packages
- If your app requires additional Python packages, install them using pip:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### 5. Run the Streamlit App
- In the terminal or command prompt, run the Streamlit app using the following command:
  ```
  streamlit run mobile_class_app.py
  ```

### 6. Access the App in Your Web Browser
- After running the command, Streamlit will start a local development server and provide a URL (usually http://localhost:8501) where you can access the deployed app.
- Open a web browser and navigate to the provided URL to view and interact with the Streamlit app.

### 7. Explore the App
- Once the app is running in your browser, you can interact with the sidebar inputs to select different features.
- Click the "Predict" button to trigger the prediction based on the selected features.
- The prediction result will be displayed below the "Predict" button.

### 8. Make Modifications (Optional)
- If you want to modify the app code or add new features, you can do so by editing the Python script.
- Save your changes and refresh the browser to see the updated app.

### 9. Terminate the Streamlit Server
- When you're finished exploring the app, you can terminate the Streamlit server by closing the terminal or pressing `Ctrl + C` in the terminal window where the server is running.

By following these steps, you should be able to deploy and run the Streamlit app locally on your machine. If you encounter any issues, double-check the installation steps and ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed.
